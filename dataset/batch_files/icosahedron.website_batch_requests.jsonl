I have a website set up on Azure Static Web Apps which has worked fine until yesterday.The last successful deployment was version 1.2.3. Attempting a new deployment for version 1.2.4 fails.After much trial and error, it seems like any changes to the deployment from the last successful one, fails with the error “Failure during content distribution.”Force-resetting `main` back to tag 1.2.3, deleting the tag, then re-creating it on the same commit to incur a new release – works. So I'm able to perform fresh deployments of the same commit, just not any newer commit.Deployment of the modified code to a development environment works. But in production, the deployment fails every time. I'm not alone in having this problem:https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps/issues/632#issuecomment-2179548456I’ve tried to clear the GitHub Actions cache. What else should I try?

Per track EQing applied too.Waveform shape on the Amiga version shows clear signs of compressor treatment (DBX266A). Overall waveform offset is probably caused by minor dc offset variation in the sampled sounds.#Amiga #Protracker #Remastering"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

While it doesn't have the nice visuals on the console's screen, it also shows the debug log of the modchip. So I'm attaching it here as well:It starts with a few reads on the SPI bus to addresses 0 and 0x2ff (SPI boot configuration bytes), then a read to 0x200 (boot header). Then a glitch is inserted (not really shown) after which the console reads the payload binaries at 0x1000 and 0x2000. After that, it shows a few messages saying that it managed to get code execution on the DSi, together with enabling DRAM (and sending a few test bytes to check if it's working), and finally it dumps a few bytes of both boot ROMs."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Something about being reminded of things that will happen the next day has helped me massively to not forget them. The notification showing up 24h before helps that I actually see it and it gives me time to fix things if I accidentally overbooked myself or need to replan.You can also change the default settings so that this is always on. For me it works when I only use it for certain entries (deadlines and appointments) and don't want too much notification noise. It is one of the few things that became a routine for me, since it works so well. It may be different for you but I recommend you test it out. :)"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It's also possible to replace embedded audio streams. It has 4 hdmi, 2 vga and a single DP Input. Only thing that I miss is a second scaler and the option to do fades/seamless switching.

I'm quite hooked now and apparently have temporarily made the most edits in the last seven days in Switzerland. :DI try to add as much data about accessibility and guides for the visually impaired as I reasonably (and correctly) can. Doing this, it became much more apparent, just how many obstacles to accessibility there are in the areas around me. Focusing on those elements in StreetComplete is something I would recommend to anyone. But please check out the OSM documentation on the tags related to those questions before adding data. They are quite specific and sometimes it's simply better to refrain from answering a question if you have no experience being dependent on such information and can't ask someone who is.Thanks to the #streetcomplete team, anyone mapping for #osm and anyone contributing to #opendata ❤️"}], "max_tokens": 10}}
