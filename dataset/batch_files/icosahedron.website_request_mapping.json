While it doesn't have the nice visuals on the console's screen, it also shows the debug log of the modchip. So I'm attaching it here as well:It starts with a few reads on the SPI bus to addresses 0 and 0x2ff (SPI boot configuration bytes), then a read to 0x200 (boot header). Then a glitch is inserted (not really shown) after which the console reads the payload binaries at 0x1000 and 0x2000. After that, it shows a few messages saying that it managed to get code execution on the DSi, together with enabling DRAM (and sending a few test bytes to check if it's working), and finally it dumps a few bytes of both boot ROMs."

The notification showing up 24h before helps that I actually see it and it gives me time to fix things if I accidentally overbooked myself or need to replan.You can also change the default settings so that this is always on. For me it works when I only use it for certain entries (deadlines and appointments) and don't want too much notification noise. It is one of the few things that became a routine for me, since it works so well. It may be different for you but I recommend you test it out. :)"

Doing this, it became much more apparent, just how many obstacles to accessibility there are in the areas around me. Focusing on those elements in StreetComplete is something I would recommend to anyone. But please check out the OSM documentation on the tags related to those questions before adding data.
